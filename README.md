#### CSS
Need to move over to SASS to help make things cleaner
- [ ] Create build process to compile SASS
- [ ] Refactor CSS to SASS

#### JS
app.js is handling routing 
- Currently pointing to /draft-day with /home being commented out (focus has been draft-day functionality)
- Once we are ready to develop other views, we'll need to adjust routing accordingly

##### Controllers
draft.controller.js
- Designated for the draft day view, and holds the bulk of the logic for handling draft data
- This one needs to be refactor real bad. I have over 20 scope variables that are just empty objects, most of them are being used, but I'm sure there are a few that I haven't even touched. **I am very okay with redoing this approach, when I built it quick and dirty this was the readily available idea at the moment.**
- I have a function called **fullBench** (notifies the user when their bench is full and disables certain functionality) that has the skeleton of a switch case. This may be how we should approach this and other functions in this entire file :/
- We'll want to refactor our approach to what I did in lines 183 to 205 (looks incredibly messy)
- You'll see that I have a bunch of conditionals starting on line 225 that could possibly be refactored to make it much cleaner
- I have old logic for a sortable list in here as well, but the sorted list is currently non functional and the actual logic is being hanlded on the home.controller.js
- I also have two directives that handled defunct code that I may need to bring back for a different iteration that I want to make.

##### Services
home.controller.js
- All of this code is how I tried to handle a sortable table within a modal. The table works fine, but the table is ill-conceived.wa

# TO BE COMPLETED
